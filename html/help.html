                <p>Below are instructions for using <i>GAuth</i>. To return to
                <i>GAuth</i>, tap the <b>Menu</b> button at the right of the
                bottom toolbar and then tap <b>Hide help</b>.</p>
                <p>To see more information, go online to
                <u>http://techtransit.blogspot.com/p/gauth.html</u>.</p>
		<h2>Compatible services</h2>
		<p><i>GAuth</i> should be compatible with all services that support
		<i>Google Authenticator</i>. It has been tested with:</p>
		<ul>
		<li>Google Accounts</li>
		<li>Dropbox</li>
		</ul>
                <h2>Setting up your account</h2>
                <p><b>Note:</b> If you have previously set up an Authenticator
                on a different device you will need to repeat the process (ie,
                redo on Google) unless you recorded the secret. The secret
                cannot be extracted from <i>Google Authenticator</i> or other
		services by an end
                user. If you did record the secret skip to step 3.3 below.</p>
                <p>To set up your account, go to Google's two-step
                authentication settings at <u>https://account.google.com</u> on
                your phone or computer web browser and follow these steps:</p>
                <ol>
                	<li>Follow Google's or other online services' process,
			selecting <b>Android</b> when asked to identify your device.</li>
                        <li>If on a computer:
                        	<ol>
                                    <li>Scan the QR code with the <i>MeeScan</i>
				    or <i>CodeCam</i> application.</li>
                                    <li>Once the code is recognised, <b>copy
                                    all</b> of the text to the clipboard.</li>
                                    <li>Open the <i>Web</i> application and
                                    <b>paste</b> the text into the address bar
                                    and tap <b>Go</b>.</li>
                                    <li><i>GAuth</i> should now reopen with the
                                    token loaded. If it doesn't, <b>quit</b> it
                                    fully first and retry from <i>Web</i>,
                                    otherwise follow the next procedure.</li>
                                </ol></li>
                        <li>If on the phone or the above procedure didn't work:
                        	<ol>
                                	<li>Tap the link which says <b>Can't
                                        scan the code?</b>.</li>
                                        <li>Copy the secret to the clipboard.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>Open <i>GAuth</i> and tap the <b>
                                        Settings</b> cog in the bottom toolbar.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>If only a black screen and no
                                        settings appear you need to reboot your
                                        phone and copy the secret to the
                                        clipboard again.</li>
                                        <li>Enter the name you would like for
                                        the token in the <b>Name</b> area. If you are
					adding a token then go to the end of the
					current text, put a comma "," then the new
					name. Do not use commas in the name.</li>
                                	<li>Paste the secret into the
                                        <b>Secret</b> area. If you are adding a token
					then go to the end of the current text, put a
					"," then the new secret.</li>
                                        <li>Quit the settings screen and return
                                        to <i>GAuth</i>. It should now reload
                                        with the new token.</li>
                                </ol></li>
                </ol>
		<p>Simply repeat the process for every token you need. <i>GAuth</i>
		maintains an ordered list of all of your tokens.</p>
                <h2>Using the token</h2>
                <p>To use the token simply load <i>GAuth</i> when Google or other
		online service requests a code. If the current token is not the one
		you are after, tap the blue header and choose the token you want from
		the <i>Choose PIN</i> list.
		Then type the value displayed into the web browser. If
                the request is on the phone itself you can press
                <b>Copy</b> on the bottom toolbar and then use Paste in the
                text box on the form.</p>
		<p>The code automatically updates every 30 seconds and
                turns red to indicate when it is about to expire.</p>
                <p>If <i>No secret</i> is shown, you must first redo the setup
                procedure above.</p>
		<p>If you no longer have use for a particular token, make it active
		and then select <b>Remove this account</b> from the menu button.</p>
		<p>An inverted mode can be enabled from the Settings.</p>
